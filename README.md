# Non-Blocking Concurrent Data Structures in Rust

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/siddharth1729/nonblocking_datastructures)](LICENSE)

Welcome to the Non-Blocking Data Structures repository in Rust! This project aims to provide efficient and thread-safe data structures that enable non-blocking, concurrent operations. Non-blocking data structures are essential for building high-performance and scalable applications in a multi-threaded environment.

## Introduction

Non-blocking data structures are designed to allow multiple threads to access and manipulate data concurrently without the need for locks. This can lead to better scalability and reduced contention in multi-threaded applications. This repository will house various non-blocking data structures implemented in Rust, providing you with the tools to build efficient and high-performance concurrent systems.

We have implemented a Non-blocking Queue and plan to expand the collection with more non-blocking data structures in the future. Feel free to contribute to the project or request specific data structures you'd like to see.

## Usage

To use the non-blocking data structures in your Rust project, you can add this repository as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:
